        Welcome to Dusty's Card Shop!</h1>
        <p>This is Dusty's Card Shop's new website!  This site is not an e-commerce platform but rather a way to see what is new at DCS.  I will be posting everything new for the week here on this site.  Enjoy and let me know if there is anything I need to add.</p>

    <p>Welcome The New DCS Website!  It will take some time for this new site to work properly, but I am determined to get it to do so.  We were closed last Sunday due to the snowy weather, but we should be open this next weekend unless we get another round of winter weather.  This winter has been a great one for snow lovers.  Personally, I am a snow lover so this has been excellent for me!  I am loving every minute of it!</p>
    <h2>NEW THIS WEEKEND!!!</h2>
    <p>I sent off around 10 cards to be graded last weekend so hopefully I will get them in this weekend. I know some of you guys only purchase graded cards so there will be something for you soon!  I am trying to send off cards of different sports so everyone has something they like.  I know I have some Kobe's, Lebron's, Wemby's, Griffy's, and Mahome's.  Basketball, Baseball, and Football!
    </p>
    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>I am sorry to say, but there will be no more video games at Dusty's.  There are still some PS4 and XBox One games in stock, but after that there will be no more at Dusty's!  Therefor, I am selling the remaining inventory at extremely low prices!  So take advantage of this! </p>
